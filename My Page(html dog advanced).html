<h3>The different types of input are text,number,email,password,tel,url,submit,search,range,hidden,color,list</h3>

<form method="post">

<input type="search"><br/>
*This is just a text bar named for search<br/><br/>


<input type="number" name="quantity" step="2" min="20" max="30"><br/>
 *The user will be able either to type directly into the field or, if using the arrows, cycle between 20 and 30, two units at a time.<br/><br/>

<input type="range" name="temperature" min="15" max="25" step="0.5" value="18.5"><br/>
*An alternative to the digits-in-a-text-box approach can be achieved using type="range".
By default, this should be displayed as a horizontal bar with a slider in the middle of it. The user can then adjust the slider left and right, 
the far left resulting in a value of 0 and the far right a value of 100. 
This range can be adjusted using the min and max attributes.<br/><br/>


<input type="color" value="#ff8900"><br/>
*Finally, type="color" is designed to allow a user to select a color, sending a six-digit hex code as its value.<br/><br/>

<label for="email_address">Email address</label><br/>
*Study about the label and for etc<br/><br/>


<input name="country" list="country_name">
<datalist id="country_name">
    <option value="Afghanistan">
    <option value="Albania">
    <option value="Algeria">
    <option value="Andorra">
    <option value="Armenia">
    <option value="Australia">
    <option value="Austria">
    <option value="Azerbaijan">
    <!-- etc. -->
</datalist><br/>
*The value of the list attribute in the input element (which could be any of the text-like input types) binds it to a datalist element with the corresponding ID (country_name, in this example). 
As a user types in the text field, if what they type matches the start of anything in the data list, those matches will be shown underneath the text field as suggestions.
 So, here, if A is typed, the 8 countries beginning with A are displayed. If L is typed after A, the list of suggestions will reduce to just Albania and Algeria, and so on. The data sent when the form is submitted will be whatever is in the text field - 
it could be something selected from the list or it could be something completely different, <b>&quot;inputted&quot;</b> by the user.<br/><br/>
